            <p>
            From its humble beginnings as a campus ministry in the 70â€™s, otherwise known as the Jesus People Movement, Christ, the Living Stone Fellowship blossomed into a global prophetic ministry with more than 500 churches in the Philippines and worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>
            Prophesied twice by leading prophets as a Philadelphia church, CLSF seeks to remain faithful to the calling, the character, grace and anointing of the Philadelphia church as written in Rev. 3:7-13. As a prophetic church, CLSF will continue to proclaim
            the Gospel of the Kingdom (Matt. 24:14), plant more churches all over the Philippines and many parts of the world pursuant to the Great Commission (Matt. 28:18-20) and raise up the Bride of Christ (Rev. 19:7) in these Last Days.
